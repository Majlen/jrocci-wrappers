The repository contains wrappers originally developed for [GUOCCI](https://github.com/Majlen/guocci).
It can be used as a replacement for jOCCI libraries.

This is not meant to be 100% feature complete, the goal is to provide the methods and classes used in the projects depending on it.
Pull Requests implementing more features are welcome.
